# Javascript Quiz

## Description
This is a timed quiz to see how well you can answer questions about Javascript!

## Usage
Click the start button to begin. The timer will start from 100 seconds, and questions with options in buttons will appear. Any choice will advance to the next question, but if the user slectes the correct one, it will say "Correct!" and if it's incorrect, it will say "Incorrect!". A score will be added at the end.

## Credits
Bits of code were scavenged from what I've learned so far, Penn LPS Activities, and web searches.
